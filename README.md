# Data Visualization Final Project

This repository contains the work for my (solo) final project for Data
Visualization in the USF MSAN program. A couple of notes about the repo:

- All of the code is contained in the code directory, which is comprised
  primariy of iPython notebooks. The primary library used for data
  collection was nba_py, while the visualization library was plotly. Plots
  were exported to html and then embedded in the webpage.
- Since the data was pulled from nba.stats.com via the nba_py package, there
  is no data stored in the repo. See the iPython notebooks for how the data
  was extracted.
- The webpage was hosted using github pages. As recommended by Alark in
  class, I used a modified version of the free Massively template that can be
  found online.
